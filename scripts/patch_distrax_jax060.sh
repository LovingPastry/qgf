# patch_distrax_jax060.sh
#
# WHY:
#   jax 0.6.0 removed `jax.core.Var` / `jax.core.Literal` (they moved to
#   `jax.extend.core`). distrax 0.1.5 -- the last-ever distrax release (EOL,
#   no newer version exists to upgrade to) -- still references the old
#   location in `_src/utils/transformations.py`. So on jax>=0.6 (which you
#   NEED for Blackwell / RTX 5090 sm_120; the sm_120 codegen + the fp8
#   rounding-mode fix first land in jax/jaxlib 0.6.2), `import distrax` -- and
#   therefore the SAC actor -- crashes with:
#
#     AttributeError: jax.core.Var was removed in JAX v0.6.0.
#                     Use jax.extend.core.Var instead
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
#   Rewrites those two references in distrax via a version-agnostic try/except
#   shim, so the file works on BOTH jax<0.6 and jax>=0.6. Note a plain string
#   replacement is NOT enough: `import jax` does not make `jax.extend`
#   available, so we must import the symbols explicitly (that is what the shim
#   does). It is idempotent, keeps a `.bak` backup, and verifies the import at
#   the end.
#
# WHEN TO RERUN:
#   After any `pip install` that reinstalls distrax (site-packages edits do not
#   survive a reinstall).
#
# IF A DIFFERENT PACKAGE DOMINOES with a similar error, read the message: it
#   says "... was removed in JAX vX. Use YYY instead." -> map jax.core.XXX to
#   YYY and add the matching import. flax 0.10.2 is expected to be fine (it only
#   uses jax.core.ShapedArray, which still exists on 0.6.2) -- do NOT bump flax,
#   openpi's pi0 depends on it.
#
# USAGE (inside the qgf venv, on the machine that has the RTX 5090):
#     uv run bash scripts/patch_distrax_jax060.sh
#   (the bare `python` below must resolve to the venv interpreter, not the base one)
